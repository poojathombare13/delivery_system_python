# delivery_system_python
A logistics delivery simulation project built using Python. The system reads warehouse, agent, and package data from JSON files, assigns packages to nearest delivery agents using Euclidean distance, simulates delivery distance with optional delay, and generates performance reports including best agent selection and CSV export.
